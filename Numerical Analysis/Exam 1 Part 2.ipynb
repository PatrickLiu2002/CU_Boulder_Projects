    "The Bisection Method uses two initial guesses $a$ and $b$ to calculate a root of a function. After evaluating the function $f(x)$ at a midpoint $p$ between the two initial guesses, it updates the value of either $a$ or $b$ depending on the sign of $f(p)$. While the Bisection Method does not require a derivative for the function, its rate of convergence is relatively slow as it converges linearly. It also requires the signs of $a$ and $b$ to be opposites of each other, so a given root must be a point where $f(x)$ crosses the x-axis instead of just \"touching\" it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's Method uses the derivative of a function at a given estimate p to compute the next estimate. It only requires a single estimate $p_n$, and subtracts $\\frac{f(p_n)}{f'(p_n)}$ from it to compute the next estimate $p_{n+1}$. Newton's Method converges quadratically if certain conditions are met, allowing it to converge more quickly than the Bisection Method. However, Newton's Method requires the derivative to be calculatable, and can fail if the initial guess is not accurate enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Secant Method uses two guesses in order to compute the next estimate. By computing the slope between the previous guess and the one before it, the Secant Method can produce an approximation of Newton's Method without needing to calculate a derivative. It requires two initial guesses that are close enough to each other and to the root, and converges slower than Newton's Method does. \n",
    "\n",
    "Muller's Method allows complex roots to be found with a real initial guess, unlike the three previous methods. It uses three initial guesses to construct a quadratic polynomial that passes through the three guesses' positions on $f(x)$, and then solves the polynomial to create a new guess. Muller's option works for almost any initial approximation, and failures are very rare. "

    "The Lagrange Interpolation uses a set of $n + 1$ points to construct a polynomial of an order of at most $n$. It does this by summing multiple functions $L(k)$ where $L(k) = f(k)$ and $L(a) = 0$ for $a \\neq k$. Each function $L(k)$ is constructed through the total product of $(x - x_n)/(x_k - x_n)$ for all $n \\neq k$, and this product is multiplied by $f(x_k)$. After all $L(k)$ are summed together, the polynomial is constructed. Lagrange Interpolation is efficient and easy to calculate, but may be inaccurate depending on the points chosen. Calculating the derivative of a Lagrange interpolating polynomial can also take more resources as the initial polynomial must be broken down into the form $ax^n + bx^{n - 1} + ...$ before a derivative can be computed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical differentiation is important as it allows for derivatives to be calculated when manual interpertation is not possible or difficult. Finding the length of a curved object, as well as calculating speed, can be accomplished using numerical differation: For example, while there is no real function for the position of a car, the speed of a car at any given moment can be calculated using numerical differentiation.
